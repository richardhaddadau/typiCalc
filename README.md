<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Quick Calc is a fun project I decided to do on the side. Despite having a long experience in development:

I never built a calculator app in my studies
I never grouped my projects on Git
In a mission to start sharing my work, I decided to do side projects that I can share publicly and start developing my Git profile. This will be the first of those side projects.

I decided to build this Calculator app without any libraries or frameworks. Just Vanilla JS and plain CSS.

It's already a very light project and I won't be using much of the functionality that libraries and frameworks provide. To avoid the added, unnecessary, bloating, I decided on just leaving it simple.

One HTML file for user interaction.
