Why Build Quick Calc?
======
Quick Calc is a fun project I decided to do on the side.
Despite having a long experience in development:
- I never built a calculator app in my studies
- I never grouped my projects on Git

In a mission to start sharing my work, I decided to do side projects that I can share publicly
and start developing my Git profile. This will be the first of those side projects.

About the Project
======
I decided to build this Calculator app without any libraries or frameworks.
Just Vanilla JS and plain CSS.

It's already a very light project and I won't be using much of the functionality that libraries and frameworks provide.
To avoid the added, unnecessary, bloating, I decided on just leaving it simple.

One HTML file for user interaction.
